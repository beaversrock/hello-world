# hello-world
This is my very first attempt at githubbing....
While I've done a bit of programming in my life, and I definitely understand some of the basic ins and outs of coding, I've not created or used my background or skills to create or use something for a job or hobby in many years. 

I enjoy coding, I enjoy writing, I think this may be the best most fun thing ever.
